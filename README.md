# inverted-pendulum-control
## Overview:
This project focuses on controlling an inverted pendulum, a system comprising a cart that performs linear motion and a pendulum capable of rotation. This system is often used for testing controllers due to its non-linear and inherently unstable nature. The primary objective is to maintain the pendulum in an upright position while keeping the cart at a desired location. A common approach in the industry is to use a PID controller, known for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this implementation, two PID controllers are employed: one to maintain the pendulum's upright position and the other to drive the cart to the desired position. These controllers' actions are then combined. However, tuning such a controller can be challenging. Therefore, in this project, Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization is utilized to learn the controller gains. Initially, random gains are set, and the simulation runs repeatedly, adjusting the gains based on the gathered experience. Given that the simulation represents a black-box function, GA optimization is an appropriate method for this task
